		\hline
		grouping & Activities that involved users grouping or ungrouping nodes (by any means)\\
		\hline
		grouping-group &  When a user grouped a node \\
		grouping-ungroup & When a user ungrouped a node \\
		grouping-complex & When a user grouped a complex set of noes \\
		\hline
		\hline
		graph & Activities related to understanding a graph conceptually \\
		\hline
		graph-explain & Notice and comment on information in the graph. An example is in exercise one where some users noticed that weight data is both manually and automatically logged. This information is not usually relevant to the question. \\
		graph-understanding & Correctly understand a concept from the graph, usually directly in response to a question. \\
		\hline
		\hline
		lineage & Correctly identifying information related to the lienage of a node. \\
		\hline
		lineage-identify & Correctly identified simple lineage. \\
		lineage-implied & Correctly identified lineage passing through multiple entities. \\
		lineage-complex & Correctly identified lineage that was complex, usually identifying multiple nodes. \\
		\hline
		\hline
		interface & When a user uses a specific bit of the ProvOwl interface. \\
		\hline
		interface-export-image & Using the export -> image menu item to save an image of a graph.\\
		interface-os-screenshot & Using the operating system screenshot functionality to save an image of a graph. \\
		interface-rename & Using the rename function (found in the contexual links in a nodes details) to rename a node. \\
		interface-manual-group & Manually group nodes by ctrl+clicking multiple nodes and selecting \textit{group nodes} from the contexual menu. \\
		interface-search-group & Grouping nodes by searching for the nodes they want to use using the search function and then grouping them. \\
		\hline
		\hline
		privacy & Whether a user was privacy concious at all in relation to personal data. \\
