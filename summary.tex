\chapter{Summary}
	% Your approach
	% Problem
As digital objects become increasingly important in people's lives, people may need to understand the 
\emph{provenance}, or lineage and history, of an important digital object,
to understand how  it was produced.
This is particularly important for objects created from large, multi-source collections of personal data.
As the metadata  describing provenance, Provenance Data, is commonly represented as a labelled directed acyclic graph,
the challenge is to create effective interfaces onto such graphs
so that people can understand the provenance of key digital objects.
This unsolved problem is especially challenging for the case of novice and intermittent users and
complex provenance graphs.
%%
	% Your approach
We tackle this by creating an interface based on a \emph{clustering} approach.
This was designed to enable users to view provenance graphs,
and to simplify complex graphs by combining several nodes.

	% Contribution
Our core contribution is the design of an interface that supports clustering
and its analytic evaluation in terms of desirable properties of visualisation interfaces.
